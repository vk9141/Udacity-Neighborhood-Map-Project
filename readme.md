#South Oak Park, IL Neighborhood Map
 
##About
 
This is submitted as the Udacity Neighbourhood Map project.  The website is a map of the neighborhood I enjoy with my young family. 
 
When the map loads there are a set of markers pinned at locations that mean something to us.   The names of the locations are also listed in buttons.  To filter the locations, start typing in the filter box and only locations that match your search term will be shown.
 
When you click on a location’s button or it’s marker it will load a brief description, a picture and a website link from Yelp’s API.
